</h1>


The Tracker App. simply allows the user to create an element (company) and inside each element has a list inside a table where he/she can keep track of his/hers sub-elements whether he/she finished their tasks or not. For this case a one-to-many relationship between the companies and games has been established and used as an example of how the app is working. 

The user also has a one-to-many relationship with the company in which each user can own as much as company as he/she wants without interfering with the other users.
